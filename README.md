GentStyle is an e-commerce web application that sells men's clothes. As this is my first Next JS project, I have implemented some basic features that appear on e-commerce websites. So, I'm willing to improve it with new eye-catching UI and interactive features.

#Key Features:
1. Users can add products and manage them on the cart page.
2. A payment system is applied where users can buy items that have been added to the cart.
3. Users can do the above tasks if he/she is logged in. I've used NextAuth for user authentication, which is based on the JWT token method.
